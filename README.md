# lab1-Arduino Matlab
in this lab we will try to link arduino with matlab in three different ways   
Each group will be asked to accomplish two simple tasks  
## Task1 : Live temperature plotter in matlab

  * in this task you will write both arduino code and matlab code.  
  * arduino code should read temperature from lm35 sensor and send it to matlab on serial port.  
  * this is initiated when  the push button is pressed if the button is pressed again you should stop sending data serially.  
  * on matlab side your matlab script should receive the data sent serially (temperature) and live plot it versus time.  
## Task2 : Getting Started with MATLAB Support Package for Arduino

  * in this task you should use only matlab code accomplish it successfully  
  * in this task you should use Matlab support Package for Arduino to Controlling led intensity using potentiometer.  
  * first you should install MATLAB Support Package for Arduino Hardware you can find instructions in the following link
  https://www.mathworks.com/videos/install-the-matlab-and-simulink-support-packages-for-arduino-106497.html
  * you will also need to Setup and Configure Arduino Hardware you can find instructions in the following link
